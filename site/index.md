# Overview

**Nestipy** is a Python framework inspired by NestJS and built on top of **Litestar** or **FastAPI**. It adheres to NestJS's modular architecture, offering a structured approach to developing APIs that's intuitive and enjoyable.
With **Nestipy**, developers can create scalable and maintainable APIs effortlessly. The framework embraces key features like dependency injection, type annotations, decorators, and code generation, facilitating the creation of clean and testable codebases.
While not a direct translation of NestJS to Python, **Nestipy** is tailored specifically for Python developers, including data scientists, analysts, and engineers. Its goal is to empower them in crafting robust and efficient APIs for their data-centric applications.
Notably, **Nestipy** extends its functionality to support **GraphQL** through integration with **Strawberry**. This allows developers to harness the power and flexibility of GraphQL within the **Nestipy** framework.


### Dynamic module
**Nestipy** introduces a dynamic module feature inspired by NestJS, allowing for the creation of modules with dynamic access to the Inversion of Control (IOC) container. This functionality mirrors NestJS's dynamic module behavior, enabling seamless interaction with dependencies registered in the IOC container. By leveraging this feature, developers can build highly adaptable architectures within Nestipy applications, fostering modularity and efficient resource management across the application. This empowers developers to craft scalable and maintainable solutions, aligning with the intuitive and powerful approach of NestJS dynamic modules.
